1,Shallow Neural Networks,Python,"This notebook develops a Shallow Neural Network to solve the Classification problem using Logistic Regression. A Shallow Neural Network has one single node through which input is processed.The dataset (.h5) is a collection of Cat Images. The data files needs to be uploaded to the Files section in the colab environment. The library h5py package (https://www.h5py.org/) is a Pythonic interface to the HDF5 binary data format. Each Image is a collection of R,G,B pixel intensity values represented as matrices, also called channels. The pixel intensity values are the features that defines the Image. Each Image is represented as a single vector of pixel intensity values.","By going through this notebook the Associate
 ¥ will understand the concept and design of neural networks and its different components
